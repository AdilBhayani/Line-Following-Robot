* MatLab Algorithms
    * Integrate into PSoC
    * Intelligent way to figure out which algorithm to use for which situation

* PID Controller
    * Control Loop Feedback mechanism to keep robot at constant speed
    * Use this to generate a auto-correcting function to keep speeds constant

* RF Communication
    * Receive binary data stream and extract C struct
    * Handle data to perform some useful function

* Bluetooth Communication (WHEN ARE THEY GIVING US THIS MODULE????)
    * Used for debugging purposes
    * Bidirectional connection
