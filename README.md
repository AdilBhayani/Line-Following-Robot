## Analogue Circuits

* Light Sensor Circuits (Alex and Vaishnavi)
    * Analogue processing of signals
        * Do we convert to Digital? or keep as Analogue?
        * What sort of circuit do we use?
        * Use internal opamps/comparators of PSoC?
    * LTSpice Simulations of final signal processing circuit (DUE @ 12:00 09/08/2017)
    * Breadboard circuit and test design for accuracy (DUE @ 18:00 11/08/2017)
    * Altium Schematics (DUE @ 18:00 14/08/2017)
    * Tentative PCB Design (DUE @ 18:00 16/08/2017)
    * Final PCB Design for Production (DUE @ 12:00 23/08/2017)

## Digital Coding Stuff

* MatLab Algorithms (Adil)
    * ~~Pathfinding Stuff~~
        * ~~DFS Search~~
        * ~~A* Algorithm~~
    * Port to GCC C
    * Integrate into PSoC
    * Intelligent way to figure out which algorithm to use for which situation

* PID Controller (Sakayan)
    * Control Loop Feedback mechanism to keep robot at constant speed
    * Set up quadrature decoder and take values from it
    * Use this to generate a auto-correcting function to keep speeds constant
    * Use this to calculate distance travelled

* RF Communication (DUE @ 18:00 18/08/2017)
    * ~~Receive data~~
    * Receive binary data stream and extract C struct
    * Handle data to perform some useful function

* Bluetooth Communication (WHEN ARE THEY GIVING US THIS MODULE????)
    * Used for debugging purposes
    * Bidirectional connection
